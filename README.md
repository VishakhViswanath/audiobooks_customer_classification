# audiobooks_customer_classification
The data is from an Audiobook app company regarding the purchase of Audio versions of books.We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. The idea is that if a customer is of low potenitial, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. If we can focus our efforts only potential customers that are likely to convert again, we can make great savings. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.
We will use TensorFlow to buld a classification model for this problem
